My personal take on the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using C++.

# Build instructions

There is one subfolder for each day's problem. In each of these subfolders there is a `CMakeLists.txt`. Inside a subfolder execute the following commands:
```bash
mkdir build
cmake ..
make 
```

TODO: Add a `CMakeLists.txt` file for the remaining folders.
